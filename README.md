# hello-world
# as a boy I used to destroy all my electric toys, such as my RC-Car, because i wanted to know how it works
# finished engineering studies and thought "now i can build electric toys myself"
# you dont get paid for homemade electric toys
# you are getting paid for a bunch of boring work such as project-managing
# So now I am here, to have some fun with my homebuild electric toys
